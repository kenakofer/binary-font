## Binary Font
A smart font for hexadecimal and binary numeric tranparency.

## TODO
- Add way to type in decimal
- Space with single bit width
- Better test page and README
- Better stylization, maybe hide the numerals in the hex digits?
    - Decrease vertical distance between lines by dropping base to make them taller
    - Should be easier to handwrite
    - Add 0 nubs to hex glyphs
    - Repeating decimal notation design
- See how it works in latex
- Calculator/converter from decimal
- 0x and 0b?
    - Feels kinda bad to invisible them, and it feels kind of gross to leave them unchanged.
    - Would be useful so that eg 0x100 is interpreted correctly
- New name ideas:
    - bit dance
